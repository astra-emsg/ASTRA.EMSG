  details ("docs" folder of the NuGet package).
- TFS integration - SpecRun tests can be executed by Team Foundation Server builds without additional configuration. 
  See US51 for details.

  See US17 for details.
- Service wrapper to run SpecRun server as a Windows service (SpecRun.Server.Service.exe).

  E.g. tagmatch:bug\d+ matches for tags like @bug1234 or @bug456
- Allow execution of test assemblies with .NET 3.5 environment (.NET 2.0 CLR), configurable in the profile

  </specFlow>
- Easier configuration for executing the tests both with SpecRun and MsTest/NUnit: 
  use use SpecRun+NUnit or SpecRun+MsTest unit test provider name:
