SpecRun NUnit Support
=====================

SpecRun supports executing pure NUnit tests. With this feature, you can take 
the advantages of SpecRun (e.g. parallel execution, report) even for your 
regular unit tests.

To enable NUnit test execution, you just have to list your NUnit test assembly 
in the <TestAssemblyPaths> section of your SpecRun profiles (the .srprofile 
files). E.g.:

  <TestAssemblyPaths>
    <TestAssemblyPath>MyProject.UnitTests.dll</TestAssemblyPath>
  </TestAssemblyPaths>

You can even include multiple test assemblies into a profile. With the <Filter> 
setting, you can specify a filter expression for the unit tests to be included. 
The following example includes the unit tests in category “important”, but only 
if they are not in the “slow” category:

  <Filter>important & !slow</Filter>


Notes:
- The current implementation was tested with NUnit 2.6.
- If a test is both marked with NUnit and SpecFlow/SpecRun attributes, it will 
  be included only once, as a SpecFlow/SpecRun test.
- Supported NUnit attributes: [TestFixture], [TestFixtureSetUp], 
  [TestFixtureTearDown], [Category], [Ignore], [Description], [Test], 
  [TestCase], [SetUp], [TearDown], [ExpectedException], [SetCulture]
- Test fixture attributes are not supported.
- Using custom expected exception handlers (Handler property) are not supported
- Explicit test execution (test is executed only if explicitly selected) is not 
  supported.
- The unsupported NUnit attributes are ignored.
